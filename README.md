Meet-up Event Planner
My second project for the Senior Web Developer Nanodegree. It displays train schedule for Bay Area Rapid Transit, using BART API.

Built with React and Material UI.

Installation

Node.js and NPM are required.

npm install
npm run build
Then dist folder must be served with a static server. NPM script is available if you have `python` installed globally:

npm run server
